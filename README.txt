NOTE: Tree.c doesn't work, my function doesn't work so please use separate Tree.c libraries for testing.

Summary:
I think the important aspects of this lab were recursion and combining prior knowledge into one package.  I thought
this lab was quite challenging and ran into a bug I was unable to fix in my recursive function.  The other parts
concerning getting long button presses and reaading from the buttons were quite easy and I was able to get those
with relative ease.

Approach:
I approached this lab by breaking it down into multiple parts in which I worked on one at a time.  I first worked on
on the Tree.c library and once I had finished, worked on the Morse.c library.  After I had finished each function
there, I moved onto the main file and worked on the print functions.  At this point, there was little more for me to
do so I put it all together to finish the project and begin debugging.  If I were to do this lab again, I would 
spend more time debugging separate parts and functions before putting it all together.  The lab manual was quite
uninformative this time and there were many ambiguities, I thought this might be a possible improvement for the
next lab.

Results:
I was unable to finish the lab as I ran into a bug where I couldn't print to my screen.  I eventually narrowed it down
to my processor resetting itself but was unable to figure out anything more from there.  I spent around 20 hours on this
lab, considerably more than any previous ones but was still unsuccessful in completing it.  I would add more guidance
in the lab manual to make it better as well as creating a better and more understandable state machine as the one
which was given was quite confusing and not that good in my opinion.  I believe the point distribution is good and
hope that you will give more guidance in the future to students.  The hardest part was the recursion, definitely as
it is very hard to grasp and understand, requires a lot of thinking and burned me out.
